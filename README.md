This is created to track my personal code from the SoftUni software engineering program - https://softuni.bg

Only the code from the additional exercises will be uploaded because:

a. They are supposed to have a much higher difficulty than the regular problems.  
b. They are not part of the grading system and therefore cloning the code can't be used for cheating.

Problem descriptions will be linked from the official website and are available only for registered users.  
!important - problems are updated regularly so the solutions may not work in the future.
