This is created to track my personal code from the SoftUni software engineering program - https://softuni.bg 

<strong>NOTE:</strong> There have been a lot of changes to the problems so I will be updating the solutions when I have the time to make them up to date with my actual curriculum which starts 16th of May 2022.

Problem descriptions will be linked from the official website and are available only for registered users.  
!important - problems are updated regularly so the solutions may not work in the future.
